GE Application
==============

The GE module is a powerful component of the system that encompasses various functionalities related to data processing and analysis in the context of genomics and exposomes. It consists of two important components: GE.db and GE.Filter.

1. GE.db
   -----
   The GE.db provides direct access to the underlying database tables, allowing users to retrieve information directly from the IGEM Client DB. It offers the capability to query and analyze data stored in the database tables, empowering users to efficiently extract specific information for their research purposes.
   Additionally, the GE.db facilitates synchronization between the IGEM Client DB and the Hall Lab DB Server, ensuring the availability of up-to-date data. Users can choose between offline and online synchronization options based on their requirements.

2. GE.Filter
   ---------
   The GE.Filter offers a range of functions to filter and retrieve information from the IGEM Client DB, specifically focusing on the relationships and reports related to genomics (G), exposomes (E), and their interactions (GxE and ExE).
   
By leveraging the functionalities of the GE.db and GE.Filter, researchers can efficiently access and analyze data, extract relevant information, and explore the relationships between various elements in the genomics and exposomes domains.

These capabilities significantly enhance the research capabilities and contribute to a deeper understanding of complex biological systems.

Note: The GE module is part of a larger system, and additional submodules and functionalities may exist to further enhance the research and analysis capabilities in genomics and exposomes.
