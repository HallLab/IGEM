IGEM: Integrative Genome-Exposome Method

The IGEM system was developed as a platform to host different APPs sharing common resources and interacting with each other through a single database.
The first APP created was GE (Gene x Exposome) to collect external data sets, identify words, and build a knowledge base available for dynamic and exploratory queries.
