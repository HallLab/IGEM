Master Data
===========

The master data module plays a vital role in the functioning of the system by directing data flow, filtering information, and establishing connections with the knowledge base. It enables efficient data collection and integration processes while facilitating effective filtering and linking of terms.

Before initiating the data collection, it is necessary to parameterize the master data module, which can be done either in batch processing or through an intuitive web interface. This allows users to configure the module according to their specific requirements, providing flexibility and ease of use.

The configuration of master data involves the following components, each building upon the previous one:

Datasource: Define the source of the data, specifying its origin or location from which it will be collected.

Connector: Establish a connection between the system and the designated data source, enabling seamless data retrieval and integration.

Terms: Define individual terms or keywords relevant to the system's knowledge base. Terms act as key identifiers for data retrieval and linkage. Each term can be associated with attributes such as Group and Category, which help users filter and organize terms based on specific criteria or themes.

Prefix: Specify prefixes or identifiers to be appended to certain terms, enhancing their contextual meaning and facilitating accurate data interpretation.

By configuring the master data module in this manner, users gain the ability to intelligently handle data origin, perform precise filtering based on Groups and Categories, and establish seamless connections to the knowledge base. This ensures the accuracy, relevance, and integrity of the data, empowering comprehensive analysis and meaningful insights.

The user-friendly approach to managing master data within the Server module enables users to leverage the full potential of the IGEM system. It provides efficient data integration, discovery, and exploration, while facilitating flexible filtering and organization of terms based on their associated attributes. This empowers users to efficiently navigate and extract relevant information from the knowledge base, facilitating their research and analysis activities.
