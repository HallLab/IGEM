IGEM (Integrative Genome-Exposome Method)
=========================================
:Version: |version|


The IGEM (Integrative Genome-Exposome Method) system is a powerful platform designed to host various applications (APPs) that share common resources and interact with each other through a single database. The primary goal of IGEM is to provide a flexible and dynamic framework for genomic and exposomic research, enabling the integration of diverse data sources and facilitating complex analyses.

The GE (Gene x Exposome) application developed within the IGEM system is focuses on collecting external data sets, identifying key genetic and exposomic information, and building a comprehensive knowledge base. This knowledge base is readily available for dynamic and exploratory queries, empowering researchers to uncover valuable insights and generate novel hypotheses.

This User Guide aims to provide comprehensive documentation for utilizing the IGEM platform and its various applications. It covers installation instructions, detailed usage examples, and explanations of key functionalities. Whether you are a researcher, data scientist, or domain expert, this guide will help you leverage the IGEM system effectively to drive your genomic and exposomic analyses.
